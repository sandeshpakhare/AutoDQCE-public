- Quality scoring improvements

---

## Long-Term Vision

- Integration hooks for ML pipelines
- CLI-based execution interface
- Support for additional structured formats
- Optional open-sourcing of non-core utilities

- Replacing domain-specific validation logic
- Performing black-box automatic fixes

The focus remains on **data quality and correctness**, not general data processing.

## Summary

The roadmap reflects a deliberate approach to growth—prioritizing clarity, stability, and engineering discipline over feature count.
